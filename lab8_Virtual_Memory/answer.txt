Exercise 1
1. 2^5=32bytes
2. 3 TLB hits, 7 TLB misses, 0 page hits, 7 page faults
3. No. Because the TLB covers all the physical page number I need.
4. The virtual address is divided into 2 parts : the first 3 bits for page number, and the rest 5 bits for offset.
	We first look up in the TLB, if TLB hits, then we are done. Otherwise, we go to the page table.
	If the valid bit is 1, then we are done. Otherwise we get a page fault.
	Then we need to find a free physical page, and update the TLB & page table.

Exercise 2
00 20 40 60 80 A0 C0 E0 00 20
Everytime access a different page.

Exercise 3
Increase the memory size, so that even if TLB misses, still have a chance to go to the physical memory and get a page hit.

Exercise 4
P1, P2, P3, P4 are processes.This simulation reports a much higher percentage of TLB misses, because each time it switches
between processes, TLB will be cleared.
